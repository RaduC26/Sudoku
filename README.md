# Sudoku
Sudoku application to play the puzzle game

# How to install
Simply clone/download the files from the repository and run the python application from "Main.py". The application was designed for Python 3+.

# How to play
The method of use is pretty self-explanatory. You will be prompted with a home screen where you can press anything and it will take you to the puzzle. In case you don't know the Sudoku rules:
  - Every square has to contain a single number
  - Only the numbers from 1 through to 9 can be use
  - Each 3Ã—3 box can only contain each number from 1 to 9 once.
  - Each vertical column can only contain each number from 1 to 9 once
  - Each horizontal row can only contain each number from 1 to 9 once

# Technology used
The main library used to build the application is pygame, due to its ease of use in order to build a GUI. Tkinter was another option considered, but the builtin methods of pygame made it a much better fit.
